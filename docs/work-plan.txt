  * GCaMP6m tau ~ 750ms
  * mtp -> GCaMP
  * mvg -> RCamp

STEPS-YARO-TE
  - Bin time to 200ms
  - Bin dF/F tu round((max-min) / (3*sigma))
  - Embedding dimension = 1   (see Cao 1997, Ragwitz and Kantz 2002)
  - Receiver embedding tau is always 1.  
  - Use 6-step TE estimator

Questions
  1. TE estimator vs "ground truth" (via spiking or Kuramoto)
  2. What is effect of TE estimation parameters? How to optimize?
  3. Is it possible to demonstrate dynamic change of TE during important 2.5-3.5 seconds?
      - Hypothesis: have more TE in sensory areas in the beginning, more TE in motor areas later.
      - How to optimize window for TE?
      - Is it ok to do sliding window? What are the effects of smearing?
  4. Comparison of TE estimators, and authors (JIDT vs whatever Yaro is using)

Naive tests:
  [+] 1D Noisy shift
  [ ] 1D Noisy linear combination (e.g. velocity, acceleration, arbitrary, LPF, etc)
  [ ] 2D Pendulum vs double-pendulum (2D has 2 disjoint pairs x-v, double has all-all connectivity)
  [ ] Kuramoto - dynamically change which particles are coupled and see how fast TE can pick up the change

TODO
  [ ] Inspect Yaro Docs     W:\Neurophysiology\Projects\RUNNING\MultiFiber_Learning\Manuscript \ MS_learning_vX.doc
  [ ] Read Yaro Data        W:\Scratch-01\Yaro\data_for_TE\
  

---------------------------------------------------------

TODO - General:
[+] Understand & reply to Patricia about strange MTE behaviour for shift.
[ ] Find way to accelerate IDTxl or get convinced that it is at max. Is it even using GPU, how to find out? Find out why [200x50x12] is not done in a day 0_0. Maybe write to Patricia also.
[ ] Make a simple spiking model of a few (e.g 3) neurons, see how TE can be used to predict effect of one on the other.
  [ ] Use convolution + binning for different TAU / bin size
  [ ] Report same-bin-MI and TE - see how former increases and latter decreases with growing TAU / bin size
 
TODO - Nearest:
[ ] NIFTY - take DynSys, sweep over different bin sizes, report T1 error
[ ] NIFTY & IDTXL - Threshold on TE magnitude - simulate random and autocorrelated channels for [200x7x12] as function of number of trials, find threshold for fake conn. Try up to NDays * Ntrials. Estimate also variance
[ ] Run Yaro Data
   - Downsampled - Sweep [200x6x12] both IDTxl and NIFTY
   - Original    - Sweep [200x10x12] both IDTxl and NIFTY
   - Either one  - Single number for whisk, lick, ...
   - Either one  - Both Sweep & whisk - concatenate days for naive mouse as trials, repeat for expert mouse
[ ] Power spectrum analysis - simple model with communication on multiple timescales - progressively increase convolution TAU, see how estimators behave
[ ] Yaro wants to compute conn-overlap between consecutive days as a measure. Given P[T1] we estimated, what is the expected number of true overlaps?
