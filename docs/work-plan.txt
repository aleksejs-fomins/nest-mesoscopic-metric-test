STEPS-YARO-TE
  - Bin time to 200ms
  - Bin dF/F tu round((max-min) / (3*sigma))
  - Embedding dimension = 1   (see Cao 1997, Ragwitz and Kantz 2002)
  - Receiver embedding tau is always 1.  
  - Use 6-step TE estimator

Questions
  1. TE estimator vs "ground truth" (via spiking or Kuramoto)
  2. What is effect of TE estimation parameters? How to optimize?
  3. Is it possible to demonstrate dynamic change of TE during important 2.5-3.5 seconds?
      - Hypothesis: have more TE in sensory areas in the beginning, more TE in motor areas later.
      - How to optimize window for TE?
      - Is it ok to do sliding window? What are the effects of smearing?
  4. Comparison of TE estimators, and authors (JIDT vs whatever Yaro is using)

Naive tests:
  [+] 1D Noisy shift
  [ ] 1D Noisy linear combination (e.g. velocity, acceleration, arbitrary, LPF, etc)
  [ ] 2D Pendulum vs double-pendulum (2D has 2 disjoint pairs x-v, double has all-all connectivity)
  [ ] Kuramoto - dynamically change which particles are coupled and see how fast TE can pick up the change
