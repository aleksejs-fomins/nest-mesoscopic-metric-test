How to run IDTXL in parallel on ScienceCloud
-----------------------------------------------

1)
   If your home computer is Linux, go to bash shell and execute following command
     ssh -X -L localhost:2351:localhost:2351 -i aleksejs-yaro-key.pem ubuntu@172.23.126.132
   If your home computer if Windows, install Putty and attempt to replicate this command using it
     [TODO: Windows User: Write down detailed instructions here and push repository to git]
     
2) Inside the ScienceCloud Machine Terminal
* run command: screen
* press space
* run command: ipython notebook --no-browser --port=2351
* copy url containing word "token", paste it into your browser
* Back in the terminal, press CTRL+A, then press CTRL+D

3) Inside Jupyter on browser
* go to /work/nest-mesoscopic-metric-test/codes/analysis_real/yaro_te_idtxl-swipe-multi.ipynb
* specify parameters, run code, you will be asked to select folders for analysis. Click cancel when you have selected all folders you want to analyze
* Note: remote server is located in /mnt/hifo-scratch-01/Yaro/data_for_TE/...

4) When you get bored of waiting
* Click CTRL-S inside the jupyter notebook
* Close all browser windows containing jupyter, ignore all warnings
* Inside terminal, type "exit" several times, until terminal closes

If no mistakes were made, your code will continue to run on the server even after your home computer is turned off

-----------------------------------------------
How to open the "screen" session some time later
-----------------------------------------------

1) Repeat step 1 from above
2) Inside the ScienceCloud Machine Terminal:
* run command: ipython
* Inside ipython: run command: system("jupyter" "notebook" "list")
* Copy url containing "token", paste into your browser
* Inside ipython: run command: exit()
3) Inside Jupyter on browser
* go to /work/nest-mesoscopic-metric-test/codes/analysis_real/yaro_te_idtxl-swipe-multi.ipynb
* It should still be running, unless it is finished. Inside its folder, there are log files, you can check when was the most recent one created
* If you want, you can run analysis_real/checklog.ipynb to find out the % of completion from a log file
4) If you are done with your simulations, in terminal do the following
* run command: screen -r
* type CTRL-C, yes, enter
* once jupyter has closed on the terminal, run command "exit" multiple times until everything has closed

How to copy my results
-----------------------------------------------

1) Repeat step 1 from above
2) Inside terminal, type "thunar"
3) Inside thunar, copy directory /work/nest-mesoscopic-metric-test/sim_ds_h5 to /mnt/hifo-scratch-01/Yaro/...
* Note: If you are using Windows, thunar will not work unless you have an X-server installed. Instead, you could use terminal: cp -R source/folder target/folder
